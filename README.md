# Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults based on historical borrower data. Loan default prediction is critical for financial institutions to assess risk, optimize lending strategies, and minimize losses. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze borrower characteristics and provide actionable insights for decision-making.

# Key Features
Data Preprocessing :
Cleaning, encoding, and transforming raw loan data into a suitable format for machine learning.
Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
Visualizing trends, distributions, and correlations in the loan dataset.
Identifying key factors influencing loan default probabilities.
Model Development :
Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation :
Used evaluation metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance.
Selected the best-performing model for predictions.
Prediction :
Generated predictions for both individual borrowers and batch datasets.
Provided clear interpretations of the results (e.g., "likely to default" or "unlikely to default").
Visualization :
Interactive plots and dashboards to present prediction results and model performance.
Deployment :
Deployed the model as a user-friendly web application using Streamlit.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical loan data, including borrower attributes and loan details. Key features include:

Borrower Attributes : Age, Income, Employment Length, Home Ownership Status.
Loan Details : Loan Intent, Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Credit History Length.
Target Variable : Default Status (1 = Default, 0 = No Default).
The dataset is preprocessed to ensure consistency and quality for model training.

# Methodology
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
Handled missing values and outliers.
Encoded categorical variables using mapping dictionaries.
Rescaled numerical features for better model performance.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed distributions of key variables (e.g., Age, Income, Interest Rate).
Examined correlations between features and the target variable.
Identified patterns and trends in loan defaults.
3. Model Selection and Training
Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).
Trained multiple machine learning models, including:
Random Forest Classifier
Logistic Regression
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Tuned hyperparameters using Grid Search or Randomized Search.
4. Model Evaluation
Compared model performance using evaluation metrics:
Accuracy : Overall correctness of predictions.
Precision : Proportion of true positives among predicted positives.
Recall : Proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
F1-Score : Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
ROC-AUC : Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
Selected the best-performing model based on these metrics.
5. Prediction
Generated predictions for individual borrowers and batch datasets.
6. Deployment
Deployed the model as a web application using Streamlit.
Enabled users to upload CSV files or input data manually for predictions.
Results
The project demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting loan defaults. Key findings:

The best-performing model achieved:
Accuracy : 89.5%
Precision : 87.2%
Recall : 85.6%
F1-Score : 86.4%
ROC-AUC : 0.93
These results indicate high accuracy in predicting loan defaults, enabling financial institutions to:
Assess borrower risk effectively.
Optimize lending strategies.
Minimize potential losses.
# Deployment
